	"The role of Vincent Vega was originally written for Michael Madsen, who played Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs. Instead, Madsen opted to play Virgil Earp in Wyatt Earp. Tarantino then made the controversial choice of casting John Travolta, an actor best known for roles in Grease, Saturday Night Fever and Look Who's Talking. Travolta was paid less than $150,000, but went on to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.",
